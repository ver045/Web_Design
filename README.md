# Web_Design

This web design was designed to help analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator.
To create this analysis, I first pulled the data from the OpenWeatherMap to assemble a dataset on
over five hundred cities. After assembling the dataset, Matplotlib was utilized to plot various aspects
to the weather vs. lattitude. This included factors such as temperature, cloudiness, windspeed, and humidity. 
This dashboard provides the data, source, and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as descriptions
of any trends and correlations witnessed.
